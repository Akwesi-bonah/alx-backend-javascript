# ES6 Classes and Metaprogramming

## ES6 Classes

ES6 introduced a new syntax for creating classes in JavaScript. Classes provide a way to define blueprints for creating objects with shared properties and methods.

To define a class, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name. Inside the class, you can define properties and methods using the `constructor` and other class methods.
