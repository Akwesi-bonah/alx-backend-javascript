# Data Manipulation

## How to use map, filter, and reduce on arrays
The `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` methods are powerful array methods in JavaScript that enable data manipulation and transformation on arrays.

- **Map**: The `map` method creates a new array by executing a provided function on each element in the calling array.
  
  ```javascript
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
  console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
  ```

- **Filter**: The `filter` method creates a new array containing elements that pass a specified test.
  
  ```javascript
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
  console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
  ```

- **Reduce**: The `reduce` method executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
  
  ```javascript
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
  console.log(sum); // Output: 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)
  ```

## Typed Arrays
Typed arrays in JavaScript provide an efficient way to handle raw binary data. They have a predefined type and offer functionalities similar to regular arrays but optimized for specific data types.

Example usage of typed arrays:

```javascript
const typedArray = new Int8Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
const doubledTypedArray = Array.from(typedArray).map((num) => num * 2);
console.log(doubledTypedArray); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

```

## The Set, Map, and Weak Link Data Structures
JavaScript provides several data structures for managing collections of data efficiently.

- **Set**: A `Set` is a collection of unique values where each value may occur only once. It allows storing any type of unique values and provides methods to add, delete, and check for existence.
  
- **Map**: A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs where keys can be of any data type. It maintains insertion order and allows manipulation of key-value pairs.
  
- **WeakMap**: A `WeakMap` is similar to `Map` but holds weak references to keys, allowing those keys to be garbage collected if there are no other references.

These data structures serve different purposes and offer various functionalities based on their unique characteristics like uniqueness, key-value association, and reference handling.
